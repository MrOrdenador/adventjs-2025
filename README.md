# What is this repo?

This is a repo where I will upload my solutions for https://adventjs.com/.
I encourage you to try to solve them yourself, and if you have any questions, you can check if I've solved the problem!

I will be exclusively using git to upload my answers, so I'm able to learn and improve my git skills/commands.

I will try to keep up with JS, TS and Python at the same time.

# NOTE: 
Some of the files include comments. Using comments might get your Code Review score down. Remember to remove them before entering the solution.
