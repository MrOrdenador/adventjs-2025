# Day 5: ⏱️ Countdown to Take Off

Elves have a **secret timestamp**: it’s the exact date and time when **Santa Claus takes off with the sleigh** 🛷 to deliver gifts around the world.  
At the North Pole, they use a super weird format to store the time: 

```
YYYYMMDD@HH|mm|ss NP
```


(example: `2025*12*25@00|00|00 NP`).

## 📝 Instructions

Write a function that receives:

- `fromTime` → reference date in elf format (`YYYY*MM*DD@HH|mm|ss NP`).
- `takeOffTime` → the same takeoff date, also in elf format.

The function must return:

- The **full seconds** remaining until takeoff.
- If we’re exactly at takeoff time → `0`.
- If takeoff already happened → a **negative number** indicating how many seconds have passed since then.

## 🎯 Rules

- First convert the elf format to a timestamp. The `NP` suffix indicates official North Pole time (no time zones or DST), so you can treat it as if it were UTC.
- Use differences in **seconds**, not milliseconds.
- Always round down (`floor`): only full seconds.

## 🧩 Examples

```
const takeoff = '2025*12*25@00|00|00 NP'

// from December 24, 2025, 23:59:30, 30 seconds before takeoff
timeUntilTakeOff('2025*12*24@23|59|30 NP', takeoff)
// 30

// exactly at takeoff time
timeUntilTakeOff('2025*12*25@00|00|00 NP', takeoff)
// 0

// 12 seconds after takeoff
timeUntilTakeOff('2025*12*25@00|00|12 NP', takeoff)
// -12
```
